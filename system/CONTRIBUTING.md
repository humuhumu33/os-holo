# Contributing to Hologram OS

Thanks for helping build an internet computer. This repo is small on purpose: it carries
only *product* on top of the [holospaces](https://github.com/Hologram-Technologies/holospaces)
engine (a pinned, unmodified submodule). Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and
[README.md](README.md) first.

## Principles

- **Conformance is the definition of done.** A change is complete only when a witness
  proves it against an *external authority* (W3C, IETF, IPLD, schema.org). Add the witness
  with the code, and keep the strict gate green:
  `node conformance/w3c-gate.mjs --strict`.
- **Mint nothing.** Reuse W3C / schema.org / Dublin Core / PROV-O / EARL terms; never a
  private vocabulary where a standard term exists (ADR-024 A6).
- **Verify by re-derivation (Law L5).** Identity is content; trust is re-hashing, not a
  server. Hold this at every level.
- **The engine is read-only.** Engine-level work goes upstream in holospaces, never as a
  fork here (ADR-006).

## Workflow

1. Branch from `main`.
2. Make the change *and* its witness. Run, from `os/`:
   - `node --test *.test.mjs` (host unit tests)
   - `node <name>-witness.mjs` (your component's witness)
   - `node ../conformance/w3c-gate.mjs --strict` (the release gate — must pass)
3. For an architectural decision, add an ADR under [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) (`NNNN-title.md`)
   and, if it adds a conformance obligation, a row in `w3c-conformance.jsonld`.
4. Commit with an imperative message that explains the *why*; name the catalog row if a
   conformance change. Open a PR.

## Style

Match the surrounding code: its comment density, naming, and idiom. Witnesses are pure
Node where possible (green in CI); browser-only checks say so and degrade honestly — never
a false pass.

## Commits and the changelog

The changelog writes itself. Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` by hand — it is generated from the git
history and published live at [`/changelog.html`](../changelog.html).

- **Write [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):** `type(scope): description`.
  Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
  Breaking changes carry a `!` (`feat(api)!: …`) or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. A pull-request
  check (`Conventional Commits`) rejects subjects that do not parse — fail-closed, so a malformed
  message can never corrupt the changelog.
- **How it maps** (Conventional Commit → [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) section):
  `feat` → Added · `fix` → Fixed · `perf`/`refactor`/`revert` → Changed · deprecations → Deprecated ·
  removals → Removed · security → Security. `docs`/`style`/`test`/`chore`/`ci`/`build` are omitted as
  noise; anything unmatched falls under Changed. The full mapping lives in [`cliff.toml`](../cliff.toml).
- **Releases follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/):** cut a `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag to close the
  `[Unreleased]` section into a dated release. The Pages deploy then regenerates `CHANGELOG.md`,
  the [`git-cliff`](https://git-cliff.org/) source, the Atom `feed.xml`, and the live page — and a
  witness (`changelog-witness.mjs`) proves the result conforms to Keep a Changelog + SemVer or the
  deploy fails.
