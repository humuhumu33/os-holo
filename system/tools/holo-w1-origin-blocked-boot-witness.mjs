// holo-w1-origin-blocked-boot-witness.mjs — W1 (the keystone of the streaming-substrate design set,
// docs/streaming-substrate-design-06-conformance-harness.md): PROVE Hologram OS boots with the ORIGIN
// BLOCKED, serving its boot closure network-free from the content-addressed cache. One test, three
// laws: L3 (the store is the memory), L5 (verify at the boundary), and serverless.
//
// Two lanes, by design honest about which proves what:
//
//   HTTP lane  (always live, runs in pure Node — the NECESSARY condition):
//     · completeness — every boot-critical NAME is a κ in etc/os-closure.json (nothing boot-critical
//       is served by location only);
//     · κ-route serviceability — those κ resolve by content over /.holo/sha256/<hex>, i.e. the cache
//       CAN serve them with the origin's path-server disabled;
//     · refuse — a bogus κ is rejected (404/409), Law L5.
//
//   Browser lane (Playwright, when present — the SUFFICIENT proof):
//     · warm the SW content cache over the boot closure, then BLOCK ALL ORIGIN NETWORK and re-open;
//       assert the frame still boots and every boot resource is served x-holo-cache:hit with ZERO
//       origin requests reaching the network.
//
// Honest posture (per -06- §2.5 + the audit's no-false-green discipline): the HTTP lane is necessary
// but NOT sufficient. If Playwright is absent the browser lane is SKIPPED (neutral, never pass) and
// W1 is reported NOT fully witnessed (witnessed:false) — an honest red, not a fabricated green.
