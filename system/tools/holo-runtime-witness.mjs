// holo-runtime-witness.mjs — PROVE the Holo Runtime is a single canonical instance with NO
// duplicates. The Holo Runtime lives once at os/usr/lib/holo and every app reaches it through
// the `/_shared/` URL space (os/lib/holo-fhs-map.mjs routes it there). This witness enforces the
// invariant declared in os/lib/holo-runtime.mjs:
//
//   • the runtime is defined + present, and the ONE flat→FHS map routes `_shared/` to it;
//   • NO app bundles a copy of an engine that already exists in the runtime (no duplication) —
//     an app's own `_shared/` may carry ONLY app-only engines with no runtime master;
//   • (diagnostic) any duplicate that also DIVERGES in bytes is reported as rot.
