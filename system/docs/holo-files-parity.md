# Holo Files ⇄ Files (files-community/Files) — feature-parity matrix

**Purpose.** The single source of truth for re-creating [files-community/Files](https://github.com/files-community/Files)
(MIT, C#/C++ WinUI 3 + Win32) as **Holo Files** — a κ-native explorer that unifies files, folders and
the desktop. This matrix makes "strictly adhere / feature-complete" *provable*: every Files command
action (161, enumerated from `src/Files.App/Actions/**/*Action.cs` on `main`) is accounted for here.
No silent gaps — each is **Mirror**, **κ-adapt**, or **N/A (with reason)**, and assigned a slice.

**Attribution.** Files is MIT-licensed. Holo Files is an independent re-implementation that *mirrors its
UX/architecture as a specification* (not a port — different language/runtime/OS model). Credit Files in
the About panel and keep this doc as the mapping. When a behavior is ambiguous, the Files source decides.

## Legend
- **✅ Mirror** — re-create the UX/behavior 1:1 in Holo JS-over-κ.
- **⊚ κ-adapt** — Win32/NTFS/shell feature re-grounded in κ semantics (noted).
- **⛔ N/A** — no meaning without a real OS/filesystem/privilege model (reason given).
- **Slice** — S1 shell+views · S2 ops+undo+recycle · S3 tags/search/properties · S4 desktop unification · S5 advanced (archive/git/media/image).

## Current state — audit of the EXISTING app (corrects the initial estimate)
The shipped explorer lives in the **sibling Apps repo**: `../Hologram Apps/apps/files/index.html`
(~984 lines), served at `/apps/files/` (the OS2 holospace dir only vendors `icon.svg`). It already
covers **Slice 1 in full** and much of S2/S3 — verified live:
- **Shell:** sidebar (locations from `ROOTS()`), breadcrumb, tabs, status — present.
- **5 view modes:** Details · List · Tiles · Grid/Icons · Columns (the `vbtn` switcher; persisted to
  `localStorage`; per-platform default via `skinFor`) — present and toggling.
- **Already present beyond S1:** sort + grouping, search (local + web), a details/properties pane,
  Verify (κ re-derivation), and command surface for tag, move, delete, copy, rename, compress/extract,
  share, pin, new-folder, upload/download, trash, undo, paste.

**Therefore the real remaining work is NOT "build the explorer" — it is:**
1. **Gap audit** of the existing app vs. the 161-action table below → a punch-list of what's truly missing
   or κ-adapted incompletely (e.g. dual-pane, recycle round-trip, full undo/redo, tag index as κ).
2. **Unification (was S4, now the headline):** the shell's desktop folders/app-icons
   (`kind:"folder"` nodes in `shell.html`) are a SEPARATE model from `holo-files.js` VFS. Make them ONE:
   the desktop = the explorer rooted at the desktop folder; a folder icon opens into the same app.

Revised slices: **A** gap audit + dual-pane/recycle/undo completion · **B** tags/favorites/recents as κ
objects · **C** desktop⇄explorer unification · **D** advanced (archive/git/media/image). (Old S1 = done.)

## The κ grounding (applies throughout)
- A **file** = a content-addressed object (bytes → κ, Law L5). Identity = hash.
- A **folder** = an object whose content is an ordered manifest `{name, κ, kind, meta}`. Editing derives a **new** folder κ → immutable history → **Undo/Redo and "recycle" are free**.
- **Open** = resolve κ → the ONE `holo-render` path (preview/edit/run by type). Gateway is never trusted; every byte re-derives.
- Tags, favorites, recents, layout/sort/group prefs, shortcuts, the recycle bin, archives = small κ objects too — shareable, re-derivable. A view is a `holo://κ` that reproduces the exact tree + layout.

| BaseTransferItem (Move to… / Copy to…), FlattenFolder | ✅ | manifest moves; flatten = merge child manifests |
| CopyPath, CopyPathWithQuotes, CopyItemPath, CopyItemPathWithQuotes, EditPath | ⊚ | "path" = the `holo://κ` address (+ FHS projection) |
| CreateShortcut, CreateShortcutFromDialog, PasteItemAsShortcut | ⊚ | a shortcut = a tiny κ object referencing a target κ (already the desktop "assign-to-app" idea) |
| CreateAlternateDataStream | ⛔ | NTFS alternate data streams — no κ analogue |

## Delete, recycle, undo — Slice 2
| Files actions | Status | Holo / κ notes |

## Slice plan (each independently verifiable)
1. **S1 — Explorer shell + views.** Tabbed, dual-pane, sidebar, breadcrumb/address bar, command bar, status bar; Details/List/Tiles/Grid/Columns with per-folder memory + sort/group/filter; navigation, selection, command palette, theme. Over the existing `holo-files.js` model + the shell's tab/window/icon primitives.
2. **S2 — File ops + undo + recycle.** Create/open/copy/cut/paste/duplicate/rename/move/delete→recycle→restore; undo/redo (free from κ history); shortcuts.
3. **S3 — Tags, favorites, recents, search, properties, preview pane.**
4. **S4 — Desktop unification.** The desktop *is* Holo Files rooted at the desktop folder; folder icons open into the same explorer; one model, no duplicate paths; share-as-κ; "set as wallpaper".
5. **S5 — Advanced.** Archive, image rotate, media PlayAll, Git, open-in-IDE/terminal, compact overlay.

## Acceptance (from the prompt)
- [ ] S1 shell + 5 view modes + per-folder memory
- [ ] S2 full op set, undoable, recycle round-trips
- [ ] S3 tags/favorites/recents/search persist as κ
- [ ] S4 desktop ⇄ icons ⇄ explorer share ONE model
- [ ] Any view shareable as `holo://κ`, reproduced byte-identically
- [ ] This matrix kept current (Mirror / κ-adapt / N/A) — no silent gaps
- [ ] reduced-motion + keyboard; no console errors; no full-tree re-render per change
