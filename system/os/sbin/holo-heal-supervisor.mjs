// holo-heal-supervisor.mjs — the AUTONOMOUS heal loop. This is what makes self-healing need NO user
// action: on boot and on every idle tick, it SCRUBS the OS closure (re-verify each κ-object against its
// content, Law L5; pre-heal the missing/corrupt from the mesh; seed what it heals), appends a verifiable
// PROV-O receipt per repair to an append-only HEAL-LOG, and seals a HEALTH ATTESTATION — a UOR object that
// re-derives — so the OS can PROVE its own health rather than assert it. Invisible when healthy (a tick
// over an intact closure heals nothing and is idempotent); self-evident when it acts (every repair leaves
// a witness). The sealed ANCHOR is never scrubbed (the healer's isAnchor gates it). Origin-agnostic: the
// healer recovers a κ from wherever its bytes live (durable store · peers · IPFS · origin), torrent-style.
//
// VERIFY → REFOCUS → EVOLVE. The first two legs (re-derive every byte; recover the broken one) heal. The
// third LEARNS: the supervisor remembers which κ have needed healing before — folding each sweep's outcome
// into a per-κ history — and reranks the next sweep FLAKY-FIRST, so historically-unstable objects are
// re-verified first and (under a heal-budget) more often, while stable ones are confirmed and left alone.
// The signal is plain integer history (repairs + misses counted from the sweep's own outcomes — the same
// data the heal-log already records), no geometry, no clock: deterministic and re-derivation-safe. The
// learned ranking is inspectable via flakiness() and folded into the attestation, so "the OS adapts" is a
// proven, content-addressed fact, not a claim.
//
// Pure + isomorphic + dependency-injected (no clock, no timer, no scheduler in the core — all injected),
// exactly like holo-heal.mjs / holo-resolver.mjs: the witness drives it in Node with an in-memory store
// and a synthetic closure; the browser drives it with the durable κ-store (holo-kstore) + a requestIdle-
// Callback scheduler + the live source chain. Its imports are the healer it supervises and hexOf (to key
// the learned history by content address).
