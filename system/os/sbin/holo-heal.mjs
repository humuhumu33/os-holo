// holo-heal.mjs — AUTONOMOUS SELF-HEALING over the κ-addressed, self-verified substrate. Detection
// already exists everywhere (the SW re-derives every served byte and REFUSES a mismatch, Law L5);
// what was missing is RECOVERY. A content address is a perfect lie-detector but not a healer: knowing
// a byte is wrong does not hand you the right byte back. This module turns the dead-end refusal into a
// recovery step — origin-agnostic, torrent-style: a κ resolves from WHEREVER its bytes live (durable
// κ-store · peers · IPFS · origin), and the FIRST copy that re-derives to the address wins (Law L5).
// Trust is in the math, not the source, so a wrong byte from any source is refused and nothing is
// laundered — only a copy that re-derives to the SAME κ is ever served. A device that heals an object
// keeps it (persist), so it becomes a seed: stored anywhere, reassembled into the original κ-object.
//
// Two boundaries are LAW here, not options:
//   • The sealed ANCHOR (constitution · gate-pinned constants · OS-closure root) is NEVER auto-healed.
//     If the anchor does not verify, the OS stays fail-closed and surfaces it to the operator — a healer
//     that could rewrite the law to match drifted bytes is a back-door, not a repair. `isAnchor` gates it.
//   • Healing RECOVERS the pinned bytes; it never RE-SEALS a pin. Re-sealing legitimate drift is a
//     build/operator act (tools/reseal-drift.mjs); doing it at runtime would launder corruption.
//
// Pure + isomorphic + dependency-injected (like holo-resolver.mjs, its one import): the witness drives
// it in Node with a Map κ-store + synthetic sources; the Service Worker drives it with the durable
// IndexedDB κ-store (holo-kstore) + the live source chain (holo-sources / holo-peers). No clock, no
// randomness in the core (both would break re-derivation) — timestamps for receipts are injected.
